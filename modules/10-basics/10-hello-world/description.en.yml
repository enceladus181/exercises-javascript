name: Hello, World!
theory: |
  To follow the tradition we'll start with writing 'Hello, World!' program. The program will display following text:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
    Hello, World!
  </pre>

  To display on screen something, you need to give computer a special command. In JavaScript language the command is â€” `console.log`.

instructions: |
  In the text editor type code from the task following to the letter and then press "Submit".

  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello, World!');
  ```
  Attention: If you type `hello, woRld!` instead of `Hello, World!`, then it will be counted us absolutely different text, because in JS capital and small 
letters are different symbols with no connection at all. Letter size is called _case_ so in programming the frase _case is important_ is frequently used. 
This rule affects almost everything in code so get used to pay close attantion to case.
